# DBMS-Ecommerce
 DBMS Mini Project on Dynamic E-Commerce website
 In this project I implemented a fully dynamic e-commerce website called E-Com.
 This project was done using HTML,CSS and JavaScript for basic Front End Operations.
 Backend integration was done using PHP and SQL.
 Finally user's will be able to login to the website, add items belonging to respective category to cart, place order,add or remove item from cart,etc.
